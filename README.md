# Lido Beach Resort Website

A responsive and modern website for a luxury beach resort in Mogadishu, Somalia, built from a foundational HTML/CSS template.

## Project Overview

This project began as a generic HTML/CSS template from The Odin Project curriculum. I transformed it into a fully-realized, themed website for **Lido Beach Resort**, a fictional luxury resort showcasing the beauty of Somalia's coastline.

- **Original Template:** A basic HTML structure with placeholder content.
- **Final Result:** A professionally styled, content-rich website for a specific business and location.

## From Template to Reality

### The Original Template
The initial template provided a simple structural blueprint with generic content:
- A header with a logo and navigation links.
- A hero section with a call-to-action.
- An information section with placeholder text and images.
- A testimonial quote section.
- A call-to-action section.
- A footer.

### The Final Website: Lido Beach Resort
I replaced all placeholder content with authentic, themed copy and imagery to create a compelling digital presence for the resort. Key changes include:

- **Content:** All text was rewritten to market a real beach resort, highlighting luxury accommodations, authentic cuisine, ocean adventures, and Somali culture.
- **Design:** Styled with a coastal color scheme (blues, whites, sandy beiges) to reflect the resort's atmosphere.
- **Structure:** Maintained the original template's logical layout while injecting personality and purpose.
